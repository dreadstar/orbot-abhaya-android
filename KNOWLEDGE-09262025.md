======================

Summary
-------
Today I focused on ensuring canonical Meshrabiya AIDL sources are consumed reliably by application modules and improving the APK reporting that collects built artifacts.

Goals
-----
- Ensure `:meshrabiya-api`'s AIDL files are distributed to consumer modules before those consumers compile.
- Prevent generated AIDL from being deleted before consumers compile.
- Make the APK reporting task robust so it lists APKs produced by modules with non-uniform outputs (e.g., sensor app).
- Document the proper consumer configuration in the top-level `README.md`.

Changes made
------------
1. meshrabiya-api build wiring
   - File edited: `meshrabiya-api/build.gradle.kts`
   - What: Reworked the `distributeAidlToConsumers` task wiring.
     - Created a named task `distributeAidlToConsumers` that copies canonical AIDL from `meshrabiya-api/src/main/aidl` into each consumer's `build/generated/meshrabiya-aidl/<variant>/...` directories.
     - Ensured the distribution task depends on consumer clean tasks (so consumer `clean*` runs first) and that consumer assemble tasks depend on distribution so the AIDLs are available at compile time.
     - Removed any finalize-by-consumer-clean behavior that would delete the generated files after distribution (that was causing generated AIDL to disappear before consumers compiled).

2. APK reporting robustness
   - File edited: `build.gradle.kts` (top-level)
   - What: Improved `runApkReport` logic to find APK/AAB files reliably across modules:
     - Recursively search the expected variant output directory (handles nested layouts like `fullperm/debug/*` and deeper variant subfolders).
     - Fallback to recursively scanning `build/outputs/apk` if the variant folder contains nothing (handles modules that output to `build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`).
     - Report absolute paths and human-readable sizes in `build/artifacts/apks.txt`.
   - Verified by running `./gradlew reportApks` and observing the sensor app APK at `abhaya-sensor-android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` was discovered while the older logic missed it.

3. Documentation
   - File edited: `README.md` (top-level)
   - What: Added an "AIDL distribution (meshrabiya-api -> consumers)" section explaining:
     - Where the canonical AIDL lives (`meshrabiya-api/src/main/aidl/...`).
     - That distribution copies AIDL into `build/generated/meshrabiya-aidl/<variant>`.
     - An example consumer `build.gradle.kts` snippet to add the generated dir to `aidl.srcDirs` for each variant.
     - `.gitignore` suggestions and `git rm --cached` snippet to remove any already-committed generated AIDL files from consumer modules.

Verification performed
---------------------
- Ran `./gradlew :meshrabiya-api:help` to validate the edited build script compiles (success).
- Ran a combined assemble command to build both the main app and sensor app in one Gradle invocation; observed:
  - Consumer clean tasks ran first.
  - `:meshrabiya-api:distributeAidlToConsumers` ran once and copied files into both consumers' `build/generated/meshrabiya-aidl/{debug,release}`.
  - Consumers compiled and assembled successfully.
- Ran `./gradlew reportApks` and confirmed the sensor app's APK was found under `abhaya-sensor-android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and included in `build/artifacts/apks.txt`.

Files changed
-------------
- meshrabiya-api/build.gradle.kts — added named `distributeAidlToConsumers` and wired dependencies to consumer clean/assemble tasks
- build.gradle.kts (top-level) — made `runApkReport` robust (recursive search + absolute path printing)
- README.md — added AIDL distribution documentation and examples

Reasoning and trade-offs
------------------------
- Keep a single source-of-truth for AIDL: committing the AIDL only in `meshrabiya-api/src/main/aidl` avoids duplication, drift, and merge conflicts.
- Copying canonical AIDL into consumer `build/generated` keeps consumer source trees clean and allows the AIDL to be variant-aware (different generated folders per variant).
- Running consumer `clean*` before distribution ensures old generated artefacts don't conflict with new ones; wiring distribution to depend on clean tasks is safer than finalizing by `clean` which deleted newly generated files prematurely.
- The APK reporting logic is defensive due to varying module output layouts (some modules place APKs under nested variant directories, others place directly under `outputs/apk/debug`). A recursive search prevents false negatives.

Follow-ups / Recommendations
----------------------------
- Add the suggested `.gitignore` entries to consumer modules that don't already ignore generated Meshrabiya AIDL (e.g., `orbotservice/.gitignore`).
- Consider adding a lightweight smoke test or CI job that runs `:meshrabiya-api:distributeAidlToConsumers` + `:app:assembleDebug` and asserts that `build/generated/meshrabiya-aidl/debug` contains files and that consumers compile — this will catch regressions early.
- If consumers produce multiple product flavors or custom variants, consider making the `distributeAidlToConsumers` task detect and support those additional variant names as needed.
- Add a short comment in `meshrabiya-api/build.gradle.kts` to document why distribution depends on consumer clean tasks (prevent accidental reintroduction of finalize-by-clean).

Knowledge probe
---------------
- If you prefer to keep a small copy of the AIDL in consumer sources for developer convenience (to enable IDE code navigation without building the meshrabiya-api module), ensure that copy is marked as a stub (with a comment) and that it's excluded from builds by `.gitignore` or via Gradle sourceSet ordering to prefer generated AIDL. However, this increases maintenance burden and is not recommended unless editor integration needs outweigh duplication costs.

Status
------
- The README update is committed locally. The build script edits are applied and validated with `:meshrabiya-api:help` and a successful assemble run.

Next actions you may want me to take
-----------------------------------
- Add the `.gitignore` entries to `orbotservice/.gitignore` and any other remaining consumer modules.
- Add the suggested CI smoke test.
- Create a short unit test / Gradle task that verifies the distribution task produced files before consumer compilation.
