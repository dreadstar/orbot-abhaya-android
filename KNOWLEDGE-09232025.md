KNOWLEDGE — 09/23/2025

Summary
This document captures significant notes, constraints, assumptions, and decisions from the coding session on September 23, 2025 focused on Meshrabiya interop and making the mesh adapter mandatory across the Orbot Android project. It is intended to bring another developer (or agent) up to speed quickly.

Scope of work

Significant notes
  - Introduced `meshAdapter` implementing `com.ustadmobile.meshrabiya.storage.MeshNetworkInterface` which delegates REPLICATE, DELETE, RETRIEVE operations to `DistributedStorageAgent` using conversions from `MeshrabiyaInterop`.
  - Added a `networkProxy` MeshNetworkInterface for outgoing calls from `DistributedStorageAgent` to avoid recursion.
  - Persisted remote storage capability snapshots from `broadcastStorageAdvertisement()` into `lastRemoteStorageCapabilities` (app-specific `AppStorageCapabilities`) for future role decisions.
  - Exposed `provideMeshNetworkInterface(): MeshNetworkInterface?` and `currentMeshAdapter` to allow other components to obtain the adapter (TaskManager now uses this instead of a no-op fallback).

Diary — session continuation (09/23/2025)
---------------------------------------

What we accomplished in this session
----------------------------------
- Enforced coordinator-provided Meshrabiya adapter across critical code paths:
  - `TaskManager` now requires `MeshServiceCoordinator.provideMeshNetworkInterface()` and fails fast when the adapter is missing.
  - `ServiceLayerCoordinator` now lazily obtains the Meshrabiya adapter and initializes `DistributedStorageAgent` with it.
- Centralized conversion helpers and added mapping helpers in `MeshrabiyaInterop.kt` to translate compute `TaskExecutionRequest` objects into Meshrabiya `DistributedFileInfo` when needed.
- Extracted inline anonymous mock adapters in `ServiceLayerCoordinator` into small named private classes for clarity and testability (`SimpleGossipProtocol`, `SimpleQuorumManager`, `SimpleResourceManager`, `MockPythonExecutor`, `MockLiteRTEngine`).
- Created `ComputeMeshNetworkAdapter.kt` (named compute-level adapter) and wired it to optionally accept a Meshrabiya delegate from `MeshServiceCoordinator` so compute requests can be delegated when available.
- Added an explicit import fix for the `toDistributedFileInfo` extension into `ComputeMeshNetworkAdapter` and validated compilation locally.
- Ran a full `clean assembleDebug` and multiple focused `:app:compileNightlyDebugKotlin` builds to validate the changes; builds completed successfully (logs captured in `build_output.log`).

Remaining todos (current state)
-------------------------------
- Sweep remaining anonymous adapters: Completed for production app code (extracted in `ServiceLayerCoordinator`); tests and Meshrabiya library intentionally retain anonymous objects where appropriate.
- Restore `.bak` interop tests: Not started. Move `.bak` files back into the test tree and run interop unit tests.
- Add storage adapter delegation unit test: Not started. Create unit tests that mock `DistributedStorageAgent` and assert `meshAdapter` delegations.
- Integrate `BetaTestLogger` into compute & service: Not started. Produce an integration plan and map logging points.
- Delegate compute to Meshrabiya end-to-end: In-progress conceptually; mapping helpers and temporary-file envelope approach implemented, but unit tests and integration tests remain to be added to validate behavior.

Verification artifacts
----------------------
- Full build log: `build_output.log` at repo root (contains assembleDebug and focused compile outputs).
- Focused compile verified `ComputeMeshNetworkAdapter.kt`, `ServiceLayerCoordinator.kt`, and `TaskManager.kt` compile cleanly after the edits.

Next recommended actions
------------------------
1. Restore `.bak` interop tests and run them; fix any conversion mismatches found.
2. Add unit tests for `ComputeMeshNetworkAdapter` delegation and for the `meshAdapter` in `MeshServiceCoordinator` to assert correct call translation.
3. Optionally extract the `MeshServiceCoordinator` adapters into separate files and add unit tests that exercise the adapter logic.
4. If you'd like, I can prepare a PR branch with the current edits and a short description ready for review.

End of diary entry.

Incremental progress (continued) — 09/23/2025 (afternoon)
------------------------------------------------------

Recent focused fixes and verification:
- Resolved five failing Meshrabiya unit tests in `EmergentRoleManager` by making `PowerConstraints` neutral by default and changing `applyPowerConstraints` to only override node capability fields when constraints are explicitly set. This prevented test snapshots from being unintentionally overridden (battery/thermal defaults).
- After code changes, ran targeted tests for:
  - `EmergentRoleManagerSimpleIntegrationTest`
  - `EmergentRoleManagerSimpleTest`
  Both classes now pass locally (build shows `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).

Build artifact produced:
- Built debug APK for the `app` module: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` (assembled successfully with `./gradlew app:assembleDebug`).

Files edited in this session (high level):
- Meshrabiya/lib-meshrabiya/src/main/java/com/ustadmobile/meshrabiya/vnet/EmergentRoleManager.kt — Adjusted `PowerConstraints` defaults and `applyPowerConstraints` behavior.
- Meshrabiya/lib-meshrabiya/src/main/java/com/ustadmobile/meshrabiya/vnet/MeshrabiyaInterop.kt — (previous session) centralized conversions.
- app/ and service coordination files — (previous session) adapter wiring and extraction of anonymized adapters; compute adapter extraction.

Immediate TODOS for Meshrabiya module:
1. Run full Meshrabiya test task: `:Meshrabiya:lib-meshrabiya:testDebugUnitTest` and review any additional failures. (Not yet executed after the EmergentRoleManager fix.)
2. Add unit tests covering `ComputeMeshNetworkAdapter` delegation to Meshrabiya and `MeshServiceCoordinator.provideMeshNetworkInterface()` behavior.
3. Restore any `.bak` interop tests into the test tree and run conversion interop tests.
4. (Optional) Push a short PR with the above changes and test fixes for review.

Notes:
- The change to `applyPowerConstraints` is intentionally conservative to avoid silent overriding of real hardware snapshots; this preserves tests' ability to inject controlled NodeCapabilitySnapshot instances.

End incremental entry.
