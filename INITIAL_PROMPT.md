please review the README.md and KNOWLEDGE*.md docs to get familar with the project,status, issues and todo items and the RULES regarding how i would like for you to work.  Analyze each document FULLY. And Note the KNOWLEDGE*.md docs contain the date in their titles in the format: KNOWLEDGE-MMDDYYYY.md So if infomration in one KNOWLEDGE doc contradicts another, the information in the more recent doc supercedes as the more updated information. This is also the format you should use when instructed to create a new KNOWLEDGE doc using the current date.

also review DISTRIBUTION_COMPUTE_GUIDE.md in full to understasnd the current portion of the project we are working on

also analyze the KNOWLEDGE.md and KNOWLEDGE*.md found in the abhaya-sensor-android sub folder.
